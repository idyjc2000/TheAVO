The main tecnical reason I want to talk about is that it has my votes and my posts so user's can see what they did in the website.
And it was really hard for me to submit the post number through submit button or link to the post method so I could redirect the user
to the single post. Or I spend a lot of time figuring out how to create new html post as I get new request of post.
So I made the user to type in the desired post number they want to visit and redirect them using the /single page.

I also used two main data table for the website backend. I did this to clarify which posts user has posted to which votes they participated
Other than these techical implementation all the philosophy for creating the website the way it is in the README.md

and I mostly used the CS50 Finance implementation!
