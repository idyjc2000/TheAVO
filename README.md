Hi! Welcome to project AVO:)

This is an web application where users can register and login and upload their concerns in the text editor
and the users could also choose their possible option/path/outcome where other users can vote from so the person
who posted the post can get some help. The reason why there is no option where the reader can add a new possible
option is because there is a sayting that answer is always within you.

Another main design of the website is not like other SNS, it's all anonymous. Person who posted is anonymous and
poster also can't see who voted for the option. And most importantly there is no comment section since many people
through web got hurt by painful comments.

If you have a concern that you want to get some advice, you could easily come to the website and register and
login to start. If you login for the first time then you will be directed to the "New feeds page" where you can
see from the latest posts. Here if you read the concern/problem and want to vote, you could type in the post
number into the text box and press "Go to Post #" button. Then you'll be redirected to the post page where
you could use drop-down menu to choose and sumbit the vote option. Once you vote, you'll be directed to refreshed page
where your voted is counted in. If you want to see which posts you vote then you could go to "My Votes" tab then you
could see all the posts you voted but it doesn't show you which option you voted so you could go to the post page and
check.

If you wan't to upload a concern, then when you log in right next your logout button at the top right corner, you could
see "+ New Post". If you go in there you'll see the text box and and 3 options that you could create. You could only
create up to 3 options (if there is more than 3, then I think it is hard since there is so many to choose from and
by limiting to 3, poster can narrow down their best choice), but you have to throw in at least two of them (since people
can't vote for one option), otherwise it will throw an error. Also, if you leave the text box empty and try to sumbit,
it'll also throw you an error message.

Once you submit your post, you'll be redirected to the new feeds page and see your post is at the top. And if you go to
"My Posts" tab then you'll see all the posts you have submited or created and see how many votes have been accumulated.
There won't be no end time so you could even come back and check before you die lol You'll realize it was nothing,
if you look back.

The way you initiate the website is go to the avo/avo folder and type in "flask run" in your terminal.
Hope you enjoy the ride. Thank you for visiting AVO and I'm pretty sure you'll love the product!fl
